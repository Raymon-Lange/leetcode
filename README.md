# leetcode

## Executive Summary 
My project involves tackling problems on LeetCode to assess my proficiency with the programming languages listed on my resume.

## The Project

While assisting a recent college graduate with an interview, I suggested they solve a typical coding challenge in a language they were comfortable with. After the challenge, they was asked which language I would have chosen to solve the problem and how many languages I could solve the problem in and sparked a discussion about resumes, how recruiters locate potential candidates, and how they review them. I recommended that the individual include any programming language they were confident in using, just like the one we solved earlier. 

## The Process

This project aims to tackle 30 issues within 30 days using the programming languages that I consider to be my foundation.

For each problem role, a die to pick the language I have to solve the problem. 

1 = C++ 
2 = Java
3 = C#
4 = Javascript / Typescript
5 = Python 
6 = Rust 

In the 1st commit history, you can find the prompt for the problem. 

The goal is not to come up with the best answer possible but to be able to solve the problem.
